# Accessible Components  

I've built some accessible components based on testing with users, needs of past projects, and official specifications.  

These components all reside in their own individual repositories. Some are written in ES5 JavaScript, and can be easily added to any exiting project. Others require jQuery as a dependency. While some are just straight markup patterns and any additional functionality would need to be supplied via the underlying language of a particular project (e.g. PHP, Ruby, more JavaScript)  

## Vanilla JavaScripts

## Markup Components  
* [Breadcrumb Navigation](https://github.com/scottaohara/a11y_breadcrumbs)  

### More to come...
This is an on-going project of mine that I don't see an end-date to, so please expect more scripts (and non-JS markup & CSS patterns) as time permits :)

In the meantime, if you end up using any of these components, [please let me know](http://twitter.com/scottohara)!  

And most importantly, if anyone ever finds an issue with a compontent listed here, please file an issue on the linked component's GitHub repository.

Thanks!
