#Accessible Components

I've built some accessible components based on testing and specs.  
That stuff used to live here, but now that stuff has moved to the links below.  

* [Accessible Modal Window](https://github.com/scottaohara/accessible_modal_window)
* [Keyboard & Screen Reader Friendly, Custom Number Input](https://github.com/scottaohara/Numbler)
* [Tooltips](https://github.com/scottaohara/a11y_tooltips)  
* [Hamburger Button](https://github.com/scottaohara/accessible_hamburger)
* [Auto Generated ARIA (or not) Tabs](https://github.com/scottaohara/accessible_tabs)
* [Auto Generated ARIA Accordions](https://github.com/scottaohara/accessible_accordions)
* [Hidden Figcaptions Revealed on Hover/Focus](https://github.com/scottaohara/figcaption-reveal)

There will be more to come...

In the meantime, if you end up using any of these components, please let me know!  

And most importantly, if anyone ever finds an issue with a compontent listed here, please file an issue on the linked component's GitHub repository.

Thanks!
