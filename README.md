# Accessible Components
I've built some accessible components based on testing and specs.  
That stuff used to live here, but now that stuff has moved to the links below.  

## Vanilla JavaScripts
* [ARIA Accordions](https://github.com/scottaohara/accessible_accordions)  
* [ARIA Toggle Blocks](https://github.com/scottaohara/aria_toggle_blocks)  
* [ARIA Switch Button](https://github.com/scottaohara/aria-switch-button)  
* [ARIA Links](https://github.com/scottaohara/aria-links)  
* [Hidden Figcaptions Revealed on Hover/Focus](https://github.com/scottaohara/figcaption-reveal)  
* [ARIA Buttons](https://github.com/scottaohara/a11y_button)  

## jQuery Scripts
* [Accessible Modal Window - version 2](https://github.com/scottaohara/accessible_modal_window)  
* [Auto Generated ARIA (or not) Tabs](https://github.com/scottaohara/accessible_tabs)  
* [Hamburger Button](https://github.com/scottaohara/accessible_hamburger)  
* [Tooltips](https://github.com/scottaohara/a11y_tooltips)  
* [Keyboard & Screen Reader Friendly, Custom Number Input Component](https://github.com/scottaohara/Numbler)  

## Markup Components  
* [Breadcrumb Navigation](https://github.com/scottaohara/a11y_breadcrumbs)  

### More to come...
This is an on-going project of mine that I don't see an end-date to, so please expect more scripts (and non-JS markup & CSS patterns) as time permits :)

In the meantime, if you end up using any of these components, [please let me know](http://twitter.com/scottohara)!  

And most importantly, if anyone ever finds an issue with a compontent listed here, please file an issue on the linked component's GitHub repository.

Thanks!
