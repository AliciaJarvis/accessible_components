# Accessible Components  

I've built a godo handfull of accessible markup patterns and widgts based on testing with users, needs of past projects, and from following W3C specifications & notes. Also, I just like making these things :)   

These components all live in their own repositories. Some are written in ES5 JavaScript, and should be pretty easy to add to an exiting project. Other older scripts require jQuery as a dependency. There are even a few that are just straight markup patterns, and any additional functionality would need to be supplied via the underlying language of a particular project (e.g. PHP, Ruby, more JavaScript).  

## Vanilla JavaScripts
* [ARIA Accordions](https://github.com/scottaohara/accessible_accordions)  
* [ARIA Disclosure Widgets](https://github.com/scottaohara/aria_disclosure_widget)  
* [ARIA Switch Button](https://github.com/scottaohara/aria-switch-button)  
* [ARIA Modal Dialogs (v3)](https://github.com/scottaohara/accessible_modal_window)
* [ARIA Links](https://github.com/scottaohara/aria-links)  
* [ARIA Buttons](https://github.com/scottaohara/a11y_button)    

## jQuery Scripts

### More to come...
This is an on-going project, so expect to see more scripts (and non-JS markup & CSS patterns) as time permits.  

If you end up using any of these components, [please let me know](https://twitter.com/scottohara)!  

Most importantly, if you ever come across a bug or awkward UX quirk with a component listed here, please [file an issue here](https://github.com/scottaohara/accessible_components/issues/new), or in the specific component's GitHub repository.

Thanks!
