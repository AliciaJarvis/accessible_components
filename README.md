#Accessible Components

I've built some accessible components based on testing and specs.  
That stuff used to live here, but now that stuff has moved to the links below.  
Check them out. I hope they will be useful to you

* [Accessible Modal Window Component](https://github.com/scottaohara/accessible_modal_window)
* [Keyboard & Screen Reader Friendly, Custom Number Input](https://github.com/scottaohara/Numbler)
* [Hamburger Button](https://github.com/scottaohara/accessible_hamburger)
* [Auto Generated ARIA (or not) Tabs](https://github.com/scottaohara/accessible_tabs)
